Recreating the card game Machi Koro by in to a digital version.


## From the Rulebook included in the Machi Koro 5th Anniversary Edition:
>Congratulations! You've been elected Mayor. But don't get too comfortable - the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a new stadium, a couple of cheese factories, maybe even an amusement park.

>It's going to be a tough proposition, since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery, blueprints for a few landmarks, and a single die.

>Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to earn income from establishments, build landmarks and take your neighbors' business.

>They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but Machi Koro will rise in less than 30 minutes!
